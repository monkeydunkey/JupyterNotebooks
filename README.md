# JupyterNotebooks
This is a collection datasets and an accompanying jupyter notebook containing some analysis on that set. 
Each folder contains a dataset, an accompanying analysis and a readme explaining the analysis. If a folder does not contain a readme and if someones really needs one to understand what was the aim of the analysis. They can contact me. 

Anyone is free to use the code in any scenario they feel fit
